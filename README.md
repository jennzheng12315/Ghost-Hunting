# üëªüîç Ghost Hunting

Ghost Hunting is an mixed reality (XR) project made in Unity that features the untold stories of people who have been underrepresented in history. 

## The Premise
Did you know that ghosts are real? That‚Äôs right. Everywhere you go, they float unseen, lingering in this world with unfinished business. They have been left out of the history books, overshadowed by famous white and/or male figures and overlooked because of their gender, race, or class. They need someone to hear their stories, to recognize their work in making the world what it is today, and you could help them! Recent research has discovered that through a camera lens, we can see and communicate with these ghosts. Furthermore, these ghosts typically linger near an object that is somehow related to their past. Find them next to paintings, historical artifacts, museums, or the everyday items around you. Learn about who they were and assist them with any tasks they may have for you. Help them move on to the next world in peace.

## 📖 The Premise 
Did you know that ghosts are real? That’s right. Everywhere you go, they float unseen, lingering in this world with unfinished business. They have been left out of the history books, overshadowed by famous white and/or male figures and overlooked because of their gender, race, or class. They need someone to hear their stories, to recognize their work in making the world what it is today, and you could help them! Recent research has discovered that through a camera lens, we can see and communicate with these ghosts. Furthermore, these ghosts typically linger near an object that is somehow related to their past. Find them next to paintings, historical artifacts, museums, or the everyday items around you. Learn about who they were and assist them with any tasks they may have for you. Help them move on to the next world in peace.

## 👀 A Peek Inside the Game
The game starts with an introduction.

Then the camera activates and you hold up your first image target. I started with _The Surrender of Lord Cornwallis_, a painting that features George Washington after winning the Revolutionary War. Instead of telling his story, I chose to tell the story of an enslaved-man-turned-spy named James Armistead Lafayette, whose work was vital to America winning its independence.

You can click through different options and have a conversation wtih James Armistead Lafayette. At the end, he will ask you to find a draft of the vital intel he sent that helped America win the war. That message is in invisible ink on an old pamplet. Using the arrow keys, you can move the candle to the empty space at the bottom.
